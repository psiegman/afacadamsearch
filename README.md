# Afac Amsterdam search

In Amsterdam illegally parked bicycles are confiscated and stored in the 'fietsdepot'.
You can search for your bicycle at <https://www.amsterdam.nl/parkeren-verkeer/fiets/fietsdepot/>.

However, apart from a date and city filter this website does not offer a full-text search to search by street or framenumber.

This repo contains a bare-bones python script to download found bicycles by date so that you can do your own search.
